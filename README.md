## PIERCER REVOLVER (ALTERNATE)
	The Piercer Revolver is a starting weapon that you can obtain in the very first level. The revolver's M1 will shoot a hitscan projectile that can pierce through enemies. When holding M2, You charge up your gun to release a blue hitscan which pierces through more enemies and gives MORE BLOOD (to heal). The best way to use the piercer revolver is by going near tanky enemies (such as the cerberus and the hideous mass) and releasing your m2 for a near full heal.
