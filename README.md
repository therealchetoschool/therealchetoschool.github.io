# Nero's Devil Breakers
A simple introduction to the famous Devil Breakers used by Nero. 

## Devil Breaker: OVERTURE
 The first Devil Breaker built by Nico. A comparably orthodox weapon compared to other arms, damaging enemies with electric bursts. Its name is derived from this straightforward functionality. The first Devil Breaker available in the game, this arm is easy for starting players to use. Complete mission 1 to unlock this DeviL Breaker.

## Devil Breaker: GERBERA
 A Devil Breaker that launchers shockwaves from its petal-shaped complex reverberatory furnace. The recoil can be used for instantaneous movement, and converging the shockwaves makes it fire a high-output energy beam. Beautiful design belies tremendous firepower.

## SHARPSHOOTER REVOLVER (ALTERNATE)
 The Sharpshooter's alternate fire has the ability to cause enemy projectiles to explode, damaging anything nearby and causing other projectiles to divert. With good timing, this can be utilized to eliminate groups of enemies as projectiles are near them, and can even quickly eliminate a Malicious Face with its own projectiles. The alt fire, in this regard, can be used as a longer ranged Parry with a cooldown. The Slab Sharpshooter is even better in this regard, although the player must be careful to put enough distance that they themselves are not caught in the blast.

The piercing ricochet effect of the alternate fire can be used to hit one or more targets multiple times. This effect can be greatly utilized when the level geometry is in your favor, such as between a pair of parallel walls or inside tight corridors.
